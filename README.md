Calliope is an encryption algorithm based on AES with the purpose of being more complex.

Disclaimer: this is just a demo for the encryption especification I made. It does not stand out for being optimized.

Requirements:

- Python ^3.11

- Flet ---> `pip install flet`

Enjoy.

Some of the functions code for AES implementation were obtained from Cyrill GÃ¶ssi's repo: https://github.com/cgossi/fundamental_cryptography_with_python
