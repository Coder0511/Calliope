Calliope is an encryption algorithm based on AES with the purpose of being more complex.

Disclaimer: this is just a demo for the encryption especification I made. It does not stand out for being optimized.

Another Disclaimer: only accepts 128 bits (text) and files whose content length is multiple of 16

Requirements:

- Python ^3.11.9

- Random.org api key in case you need one. My key's in the .env file, you can take it.

- Flet ---> `pip install flet`

- Python Dotenv ---> `pip install python-dotenv`

- Pyperclip ---> `pip install pyperclip`

Enjoy.

Some of the functions code for AES implementation were obtained from Cyrill Gössi's repo: https://github.com/cgossi/fundamental_cryptography_with_python 

ANOTHER DISCLAIMER: Kalliope has licence (the encryption specification, not this repos code), but the only thing you have to do is credit me. Yeah, that's all!! Have a nice day (⁠ﾉ⁠◕⁠ヮ⁠◕⁠)⁠ﾉ⁠*⁠.⁠✧
